## Risk Management & Contingencies

### Scenario 1: Live Trading Underperforms

**If returns <75% of paper trading:**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Pause capital scaling immediately
2. Comprehensive performance analysis
3. Identify causes (slippage, execution, market regime)
4. Full transparency with community
5. Adjust strategy parameters if needed
6. Return to paper trading if necessary

**Community Communication:**
- Honest assessment within 24 hours
- Daily updates during review period
- Clear path forward outlined
- No hiding problems

### Scenario 2: Strategy Edge Deteriorates

**If multiple losing months or edge disappears:**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Stop live trading immediately
2. Preserve remaining capital
3. Return funds to treasury (secure cold wallet)
4. Comprehensive post-mortem analysis
5. Research new strategies or improvements
6. Complete transparency throughout

**Token Holders:**
- Treasury value preserved
- Buybacks continue from reserves
- Pivot to new strategy (if viable)
- Or return treasury value to holders (if not)

### Scenario 3: Regulatory Challenges

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Engage specialized legal counsel immediately
2. Full compliance with all requirements
3. Restructure token if necessary
4. Protect community interests first

**Commitment:** Legal compliance takes precedence over short-term gains

### Scenario 4: Black Swan Market Event
